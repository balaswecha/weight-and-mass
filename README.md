Weight And Mass is an applicatoion for teaching a student what is the difference between Weight and Mass and how it differs with environment
This Page clearly shows that how weight of the body changes for differents environments
Differents examples were given to check the weight on differents planets and moon
Note that masss of the body remains constant as per classical physics
Steps to follow to find weight of objects in different environments

  1.Place the object on the left side of common balance
  
  2.Place the correspnding weigh on the right side of common balance
  
  3.Notice that gravity changes from environment to environment
  
  4.Fill the formalities as per steps
  
  5.Now you will be asked to place the object in spring balance
  
  6.Below tablular form shows the exact output
 
 Now we all know the steps to proceed and verify our theoritical knowledge remember that the masss of object remains constant but not weight.
